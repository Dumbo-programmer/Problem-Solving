## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-21 (contest tab + contest rating + assigned contests)

**What changed**

- The leaderboard is a **learner** board again: `/leaderboard` is behind the
  sign-in gate, the “সবার জন্য উন্মুক্ত / open to everyone” chip and the
  “Join the board” card are gone (with their `lb.public` / `lb.join.*` copy),
  and the login page no longer advertises an open board.
- The **contest tab** is back and lives at `/contests` (`/tests` now redirects
  there). It lists the weekly/monthly papers *and* the contests an admin handed
  to specific learners, and it carries the **contest rating** board — Elo-style
  points, a separate metric from the problems-solved leaderboard.
- **Admins create contests and give them to people**: new `CONTEST` paper kind,
  an “Give this contest to…” learner picker in `/admin` (`GET /admin/learners`,
  `assignedTo` on the paper), and server-side filtering so an assigned contest
  is only listed for the learners it was given to.
- Nav: `Home · Problems · Leaderboard · Contests` at `md`, `Past Tests` at `lg`.

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-19, 20:15 (proofreading/ops agent)

- **Typecheck blocker fixed** in `src/lib/scheduled.ts` (your new file): line 221
  referenced `easyMedium`, which is defined nowhere → `weeklyPool.length ? weeklyPool : monthlyPool`
  (an EASY/MEDIUM fallback could never trigger there anyway, since it's a subset of `weeklyPool`).
- ⚠️ **Re-run typecheck when your standings/leaderboard edits to `src/lib/api.ts` settle.**
  At 20:13 it had 3 fresh errors that were absent at 20:09: `import.meta.env` (line 35,
  no vite/client type in scope) and the `markYou(rows, …)` `PeriodRow[]` vs `StandingsRow[]`
  mismatch (line 269). Left untouched on purpose — the file was 77 seconds old at the time.
- Proofreading batch applied at 20:08 (see list below): Bangla label/typo fixes,
  localized test titles, PastTests summary icons.

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-19, 21:30 (feature batch: leaderboards, scheduled tests, admin)

- **New features shipped**: `/tests` (weekly/monthly calendar papers with phase
  countdowns, name gate, draft resume, per-paper standings deep-linkable via
  `?standings=`), `/leaderboard` (week/month/all tabs, problems-solved ranking,
  own-row highlight), `/admin` (id+password login → overview / problems CRUD /
  scheduled-test CRUD / submissions), filter-panel scrollbar.
- **Order normalisation**: `Tests.tsx` now sorts cards live → upcoming (soonest)
  → ended (newest), so cloud (newest-first) and offline (seed order) sources
  render identically.
- **Papers never repeat themselves**: `buildScheduledSeeds` tracks claimed
  problems (and both stores pass in ids already stored), so a rolled-forward
  week skips what past weeks tested; unit tests cover phase boundaries, seed
  identities/lengths, demo-entry determinism and `entryDeadline` clamping.
- **Two gates added**: `smoke:api` (51 checks, plain-Node handler + isolated
  file store) and `smoke:cloud` (UI journey against the attached API via a
  separate `dist-cloud` build). Local dev: `dev:api`.
- ⚠️ from the 20:15 note: the `import.meta.env` / `markYou` typecheck errors it
  reported are **resolved** — typecheck is clean as of this run.

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-19, 23:25 (learner accounts + design upgrade)

- **Learner accounts shipped**: `/login` (sign-in / create-account toggle + signed-in
  "my account" view for renaming), username+password only (no email). Passwords are
  scrypt-hashed (`scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash`, params bounded on verify); the bearer is a
  30-day HMAC session (`kind: "learner"`) that can never open admin routes — and the
  admin token can never act as a learner. Signing in attaches the real name to
  contest entries and skips the name gate; anonymous practice is untouched, and an
  offline network keeps the cached session alive.
- **New API routes**: `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`,
  `PUT /auth/profile`; `Store` gained `users` (Pg table + file-store array) and
  `overview()` now counts accounts (surfaced as a 5th admin tile).
- **Error codes**: `invalid_username`, `invalid_password`, `display_name_required`,
  `username_taken` (409), `bad_credentials` (401), `unauthorized` (401) — mapped to
  bilingual messages client-side, unknown usernames still run a dummy verify so
  timing doesn't leak existence.
- **Design upgrade** ("more elements"): Home gained a hero feature-chip row and a
  contests section with a **live top-3 podium** built from the same deterministic
  demo entries the boards use; Leaderboard promotes its top three onto a podium
  above the table; Footer is now brand + tagline + stat strip + three link columns
  (explore / compete / account) + a two-line bottom bar. `/login` ships with a
  maths-chip side panel ("why an account?").

**Re-verified after these changes:**

| E2E smoke (API attached) | `npm.cmd run smoke:cloud` | ✅ 47/47 — full signup → navbar greeting → sign-out journey |

- ⚠️ Supabase Postgres still unreachable from this machine (IPv6-only host, pooler
  ports time out) — the Postgres path stays untested; the file store proves the
  contract (as before). Remaining `npm audit` advisories are dev-toolchain only
  (vitest/vite/tailwind majors deferred on purpose).

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-19, 23:55 (retrowave theme + Prothom Alo co-brand)

- **Retrowave/synthwave theme**: Tailwind gained a `neon` ramp (pink/magenta/purple/
  violet/indigo/cyan/teal/yellow) and a `palo` brand red, plus keyframes
  (`gridflow`, `drift`, `dash`, `pulseGlow`, `scan`, `marquee`) and horizon/sky/
  sheen gradients. `index.css` adds a fixed "infinity-mirror" dark backdrop
  (two offset neon grids + violet/cyan glows), neon card/button/field treatments,
  the `.retro-horizon` rolling perspective floor, `.retro-scanlines`, `.neon-text`,
  and reduced-motion still freezes all of it.
- **Moving maths**: new decorative components — `FloatingMath` (seeded field of
  π ∑ √ ∫ θ Δ ∞ glyphs, each with its own bob timing), `MathPlots` (`SinePlot`
  self-drawing wave, `CurvePlot` parabola with pulsing markers, `OrbitRing`), and
  `PageDecor` (ambient glow + glyphs + grid floor behind page headers). Home gains
  a "Maths in motion" band; the hero, CTA panel and Login side panel are retrowave.
- **Co-branded header**: `BrandLockup` stacks the Prothom Alo mark above the Gonit
  Ishkul lockup with a neon hairline, and **renders no wordmark text** (both logos
  spell their names). The Prothom Alo SVG has a near-black wordmark, so a
  `prothom-alo-dark.svg` variant (white ink, brand red kept) is swapped in via
  `dark:` classes. Navbar is `h-24`; the mobile sheet offset follows.
- **Bigger landscape logo**: the square `Logo.png` (2250×2250) actually contains a
  1492×1016 wordmark floating in transparent margins — cropping to the opaque
  bounds (+24 px pad) produced `public/logo-landscape.png` (1565×1065, ratio 1.47,
  84 KB). The navbar now paints a genuinely wide mark (79×54 desktop vs the old
  36×36 square) at a higher position in the hierarchy.
- **Prothom Alo credit**: hero chip linking to
  `prothomalo.com/collection/math-school`, a footer partnership line, and a
  brand-red footer badge. `index.html` gains co-brand meta + `/slogan.png` OG image.
- **Netlify**: `netlify.toml` now caches `/prothom-alo.svg`, `/prothom-alo-dark.svg`,
  `/slogan*.png`, `/gonit-bhaiya.jpeg` and `/assets/*` immutably.

**Re-verified after these changes:**

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `npm.cmd run typecheck` | ✅ clean |
| Unit tests | `npx.cmd vitest run` | ✅ 67/67 |
| Production build | `npm.cmd run build` | ✅ 144 problems, all brand assets in `dist/` |
| Responsive layout | `npm.cmd run layout` | ✅ all pass (+2 checks/route: lockup paints, Gonit mark is landscape, Prothom Alo stacked above it) |
| E2E smoke (offline) | `npm.cmd run smoke` | ✅ 53/53, **zero console errors** (+7 co-brand/theme checks) |
| API contract smoke | `npm.cmd run smoke:api` | ✅ 71/71 |
| E2E smoke (API attached) | `npm.cmd run smoke:cloud` | ✅ 54/54 |

- ⚠️ Visual QA stays programmatic (the model cannot view images); the brand checks
  assert geometry (painted size, landscape ratio, stacking order) rather than looks.

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-20, 00:40 (ops: dev server + proofread re-verify)

- **Dev server (5173) is back up.** It died twice to Vite's `fs.watch` throwing
  `EBUSY` while a build/deploy wrote a locked file (`public/prothom-alo.svg`, then
  the `dist-cloud/` churn) — a Windows file-lock flake, not a code fault. It now
  runs with **`CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`** so watcher-polling tolerates those locks
  (a shell env var only — no `vite.config.ts` change). 5173 and your preview on
  4173 both answer **200**.
- **Proofread fixes from 23:40–23:45 are intact** after your 12:26–12:31 `i18n.tsx`
  rewrites (verified key-by-key); key coverage re-checked: **369/369, 0 missing**.
  `typecheck` clean, `vitest` 67/67.
- **New-copy pass on the co-brand/theme batch** (00:50): `tests.winners.ended` বাংলা
  "চূড়ান্ত ফলাফল" → "চূড়ান্ত স্ট্যান্ডিংস" (five sibling keys all say স্ট্যান্ডিংস);
  `builder.pool` বাংলা "পাওয়া যায় এমন" (dangling adjective) → "মজুদ" (the site's word
  for the bank); `home.partsLede` বাংলা "এর শুরু সমস্যাগুলো **নিজে থেকেই**" → "শুরুটা
  সমস্যাগুলো দিয়েই" ("themselves" had been misread as "automatically"). New email/phone
  account copy (`auth.email*`, `auth.phone*`, `auth.err.email/phone/emailTaken`) reviewed
  — correct. Zero hardcoded strings remain in any page (grep-verified).

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-20, 00:45 (two boards, mandatory sign-in, contact fields)

- **Board ranking rule changed**: an attempt now carries an optional `accountId`, and
  only **account-linked** entries (plus the seeded `demo-*` field) rank. Anonymous
  real attempts are filed and stay visible in Past Tests but never appear on a public
  board — the link is derived **server-side** from the session bearer in
  `handleSaveTest` (never trusted from the request body).
- **Two distinct leaderboards**:
  - `/tests` leads with a **Recent test winners** board — the featured paper's top
    three on a podium (medals, live/final label) plus a "Full standings" jump to the
    per-paper table; each paper keeps its own `?standings=` deep link.
  - `/leaderboard` stays the **overall problem-solver** board (problems solved only,
    week/month/all tabs, own-row highlight by account).
  - Shared maths in `src/lib/leaderboard.ts`: `isRankedEntry`, `isDemoEntry`,
    `entryOwner`, `markYou(rows, clientId?, accountId?)`, `findYou`.
- **Sign-in is mandatory for the competitive parts** (user decision): Home,
  `/problems` and `/practice` stay open; `/tests`, `/leaderboard`, `/past-tests` are
  wrapped in the new `RequireAuth`, which redirects to `/login?next=…` and returns you
  there after signing in. `/test/:id` deliberately stays **open** so anonymous practice
  still works — the scheduled papers enforce sign-in at their start flow (`/tests`).
- **Sign-up now collects email + phone + username + password** (login stays
  username+password). Server validates with `normalizeEmail` / `normalizePhone`
  (phone stored as digits with a leading `+`), emails are unique
  (`users_email_idx` on `lower(email)`, 409 `email_taken`), and the signed-in account
  card shows both. New error codes: `invalid_email`, `invalid_phone`, `email_taken`.
- **Store/API**: `StoredUser` gained `email?`/`phone?`; Pg schema + `MIGRATIONS` add
  the columns/index; `Store` gained `findUserByEmail`; `userShape` exposes both
  (hashes never leave the server).
- **Decorations replaced the removed section**: the labelled "Maths in motion" band is
  gone (and its 11 i18n keys). The graphs are now ambient — new `FloatingPlots`
  (scattered sine/parabola/orbit-ring/∞, seeded, own opacity/bob timings) rides in
  `PageDecor` on every page, and the Home hero carries a richer 6-plot field.

**Re-verified after these changes:**

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `npm.cmd run typecheck` | ✅ clean |
| Unit tests | `npx.cmd vitest run` | ✅ 74/74 (+4 `normalizeEmail`/`normalizePhone`, +3 `isRankedEntry`/`isDemoEntry`; board tests now account-aware) |
| Production build | `npm.cmd run build` | ✅ 144 problems |
| Responsive layout | `npm.cmd run layout` | ✅ all pass |
| E2E smoke (offline) | `npm.cmd run smoke` | ✅ 46/46, **zero console errors** — gated routes now assert the `/login?next=…` bounce; practice → runner → results still walks end-to-end |
| API contract smoke | `npm.cmd run smoke:api` | ✅ 78/78 (+7: email/phone rules, dup email 409, own-row `isYou`, anonymous attempts stay off the boards) |
| E2E smoke (API attached) | `npm.cmd run smoke:cloud` | ✅ 57/57 — adds the signed-in journeys: winners board, leaderboard tabs/podium, past tests, sign-out |

- ⚠️ Still true: Supabase Postgres is unreachable from this machine (IPv6-only host,
  pooler ports time out) — the Postgres `email/phone` columns and the account filter
  are exercised through the file store, not the real database.
- ⚠️ npm advisories remain dev-toolchain only (vitest/vite/tailwind majors deferred).

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-21 (Prothom Alo official theme + public board + admin access)

- **The site is now an official Prothom Alo property, visually.** The retrowave/neon
  look is gone: `tailwind.config.js` retokens `accent` to the brand red ramp
  (`500: #ee4023`), `ink` to a warm newsprint charcoal, and re-maps the old `neon`
  ramp to editorial red/neutral stops (the class names survive, so every usage
  follows). `palo` stays a flat `#ee4023` so `border-palo/25` keeps working.
- **Typography**: headlines are now serif (`Source Serif 4` + `Noto Serif Bengali`,
  loaded from Google Fonts and applied to `h1`/`h2` via a base rule). Family names
  with a digit **must** be quoted in the Tailwind stack (`'"Source Serif 4"'`) —
  unquoted, the whole `font-family` declaration is invalid and silently dropped.
  Body copy stays Outfit / Noto Sans Bengali.
- **Light is the default** (`readTheme()` now returns `light` unless dark was
  chosen); `index.html` no longer hardcodes `class="dark"`, and the theme-colour
  meta is the brand red.
- **Copy**: "Free · Olympiad-flavoured · No sign-up" is gone. The hero now says the
  site is the official problem-solving platform of Prothom Alo's Gonit Ishkul; the
  footer credits Prothom Alo and the copyright line names the initiative.
- **Decorations formalised**: the hero's ping badge, neon sky glows and rolling
  perspective floor are replaced by a paper wash, one brand-red glow and a ruled
  band; `PageDecor`, `FloatingMath`, `MathPlots`, `Login`'s side panel and the
  podium are all de-neoned and de-gridded.
- **`/leaderboard` is public** — anyone can read the board; signed-out visitors get
  a "Join the board" card (sign-up / sign-in). It is no longer wrapped in
  `RequireAuth`.
- **`/login` shows a real dashboard panel** (live tests sat / solved / average /
  best, your rank, and a top-5 slice of the public board) instead of the old
  "why an account?" perks panel.
- **Admin access is self-documenting**: `src/lib/adminCredentials.ts` is the single
  source of the default ID/password, imported by both the function and the UI;
  `GET /admin/credentials` is public and returns booleans only (still default?),
  and the admin login card shows the credentials (or "custom — ask the site
  owner").
- **Past tests** carry weekly / monthly / built-by-you badges, filter chips with
  counts, locale-aware dates and an "in progress" state.
- **Navbar**: links are tiered (`md` for Home/Problems/Leaderboard, `lg` for the
  archive) so the bar never overflows on a tablet; the redundant `/practice` nav
  entry was dropped in favour of the primary CTA.

**Re-verified after these changes:**

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `npm.cmd run typecheck` | ✅ clean |
| Unit tests | `npm.cmd run test` | ✅ 74/74 |
| Production build | `npm.cmd run build` | ✅ 144 problems |
| Responsive layout | `npm.cmd run layout` | ✅ all pass (mobile/tablet/desktop × 8 routes) |

| API contract smoke | `npm.cmd run smoke:api` | ✅ 81/81 (+3 for the public credentials probe) |

- ⚠️ Visual QA stays programmatic (the model cannot view images); the theme was
  verified by reading computed styles out of the browser (body background
  `#fdfcfa`, `.btn-primary` `#d92d12`, serif headline stack, the fonts actually
  downloaded) rather than by eye.

## ⏱ Update — 2026-10-21, later (single-theme build: dark mode removed)

The user reported the black/white switch as broken and asked for **one edition
only — white**. The dark path is now gone from the codebase, not merely hidden:

- **Every `dark:` variant is gone** from `src/**` (485 tokens across 21 files).
  The Prothom Alo logo now has a single light asset: `public/prothom-alo-dark.svg`
  was deleted and its `netlify.toml` cache rule removed, and the
  `BrandLockup` / `Footer` / `Home` light+dark `<img>` pairs were collapsed to
  one image (no orphan `hidden` / `dark:block` pairs left).
- **Theme machinery deleted**: `src/lib/theme.tsx` (the provider) is removed,
  `ThemeProvider` no longer wraps the app in `src/App.tsx`, the navbar's
  theme-toggle button and the `theme.toggle` i18n key are gone, and
  `src/lib/storage.ts` no longer has `THEME_KEY` / `readTheme()` / `writeTheme()`.
- **`tailwind.config.js`** no longer sets `darkMode`, and `src/index.css` has no
  `.dark`-scoped rules at all (the whole dark block — body, cards, buttons,
  fields, scrollbars, chips — was deleted; only the light rules remain).
- **`index.html`**: `color-scheme` is `light` (was `light dark`).
- **Built CSS verified dark-free**: the production bundle contains **0**
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` blocks, **0** `.dark` selectors and **0** `dark:`
  variants.
- **Regression guards added to `scripts/smoke.mjs`** (4 new checks): `<html>`
  carries no `dark` class, the body paints `rgb(253, 252, 250)`, the stylesheet
  ships no dark-mode rules, and the navbar has no theme toggle.
- **Docs/tooling**: `README.md` describes a single light edition; the
  `theme.tsx` entry was dropped from the file tree; `scripts/screenshots.mjs`
  no longer captures a dark pass and now resolves Chrome through
  `scripts/chrome-path.mjs` instead of a hardcoded path.

**Re-verified after the single-theme build:**

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `npm.cmd run typecheck` | ✅ clean |
| Unit tests | `npm.cmd run test` | ✅ 74/74 |
| Production build | `npm.cmd run build` | ✅ 144 problems, CSS dark-free |
| Responsive layout | `npm.cmd run layout` | ✅ all pass (mobile/tablet/desktop × 8 routes) |
| E2E smoke (offline) | `npm.cmd run smoke` | ✅ 53/53 (+4 single-theme checks), **zero console errors** |
| API contract smoke | `npm.cmd run smoke:api` | ✅ 81/81 |

## Proofreading already applied (no action needed)

- `src/data/problems-a.json`, `problems-b.json`, `problems-c.json` — all 144 answers math-verified; Bangla typos/mistranslations fixed (incl. `pr-h-02` title/statement/solution, সর্বশেষ, এংগেল, ক্যাটালান solution, compositions statement).
- `src/lib/i18n.tsx` — added `runner.notFound*`, `runner.answerKind*`, `notFound.body/action`, `past.statusSubmitted`.
- `src/pages/Results.tsx` — correct not-found copy; Skipped metric uses `Minus`, not `Trophy`.
- `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` — no longer reuses `filter.noneHint` as 404 body.
- `src/pages/PastTests.tsx` — status chip reads "Submitted", not "Your result".
- `tailwind.config.js` — `theme.extend.opacity: {8, 12, 14}` (fixes `@apply bg-accent-500/12` compile error).
- `vite.config.ts` — `@` alias; `public/logo.png` — favicon fixed.
- `src/lib/i18n.tsx` (20:08) — `filter.noneHint` বাংলা now says কঠিনতা (not ডিফিকাল্টি);
  `builder.randomSeed` → এলোমেলো করুন (verb, not noun শাফল); `past.totalCorrect` gets its
  object (সমাধান করা সমস্যা); `home.partsTestD` typo সমস্যানিয়ে → সমস্যা নিয়ে; `TOPIC_LABELS`
  বীজগাণিতিক/জ্যামিতিক → বীজগণিত/জ্যামিতি (noun forms — adjectives were wrong as chip labels).
- `src/data/types.ts` (20:08) — same বীজগণিত/জ্যামিতি fix in `TOPICS[].bn`.
- `src/pages/Practice.tsx` (20:08) — `buildTitle` now renders topics via `TOPIC_LABELS` +
  `L()` (test titles in Past Tests were hardcoded English, `void L`); English output unchanged.
- `src/pages/PastTests.tsx` (20:08) — summary icons: Best score `Check`→`Star`,
  Problems solved right `Clock`→`Check` (clock implied time on a correctness metric).
- `src/lib/i18n.tsx` (23:40) — new-copy fixes: `admin.f.statementBn/En` "শর্ট"→"প্রশ্ন"
  (not a word); `auth.signin.sub` calque "নাম বহন করতে"→"নাম দেখাতে"; `auth.signup.sub`
  "প্রতিযোগিতার নাম" (read as *the contest's name*)→"ডিসপ্লে নাম" (matches the field);
  `home.competeBoardD` missing head noun → "…সমাধান করা সমস্যা".
- `src/lib/i18n.tsx` (23:45) — 4 new keys for wrong-reuse fixes below: `tests.empty`,
  `lb.hint`, `admin.problems.invalid`, `admin.f.draft`.
- `src/pages/Tests.tsx` (23:45) — empty-calendar state now says "No scheduled tests"
  (`tests.empty`), not the submissions-flavoured `lb.empty`.
- `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx` (23:45) — bottom hint is `lb.hint` (solved-count rank,
  tie-breaks) — was `tests.standings.hint` ("Score decides rank"), contradicting the
  page's own `lb.intro`.
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx` (23:45) — problem editor error now `admin.problems.invalid`
  (ID/titles/statements/answer) — was `admin.tests.invalid` (mentioned times +
  paper problems); unpublished test chip now reads "Draft"/খসড়া — it rendered
  "Published"/প্রকাশিত on unpublished tests.

## Resolved

- ~~`src/pages/About.tsx` GitHub link placeholder~~ — the About page was removed
  entirely (page, route, nav/footer links, i18n keys, script routes). `/about`
  now falls through to the 404 page; `scripts/smoke.mjs` asserts this.

Remaining work, if any, is yours to define — everything verifiable is passing.
